Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is a programming language?
ANSWER: A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.
Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

What JDK contains or composed of and defines each component?
ANSWER: JDK is Java Development Kit. It develops the java program. JRE runs the program. JAVAC is a compiler, JVM runs java ByteCode.

What is IDE?
ANSWER: Integrated Development Environment is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug java programs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
ANSWER: Java SE, JavaFX, web, EJB and mobile application.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
ANSWER: Java source code - Java compiler - ByteCode - JVM - executed by CPU.

What is class?
ANSWER: Blueprint of Objects.

What is an Object?
ANSWER: A java object is a combination of data and procedures on the available data. An object has a state and behavior.

What is the entry point of an application?
ANSWER: The main method is the entry point of java application.

Why main is static?
ANSWER: Otherwise there would be ambiguity.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
ANSWER: The object class.



What is the difference between path and classpath variables?
ANSWER: path is a mediator between developer and operating system to inform binary file path where as classpath is a mediator between
developer and compiler to inform the library file path those are used in our source code.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
ANSWER: Interface is implicitly abstract and can not have implementation.
Abstract Class can have instance methods that implement a default behavior.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
ANSWER: No. You can instantiate one of their subclasses/implementers.

What is an Access Specifier?
ANSWER: (Also known as Access Modifiers)Access Specifiers set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
ANSWER:.1. Abstraction 2. Encapsulation 3.Inheritance 4.Polymorphism.

What is a Java Package and which package is imported by default?
ANSWER: A java package organizes java classes into name spaces, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains. Java.lang package
is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
ANSWER: Application programming interface. JDO, Google.

Does java support multiple Inheritance, explain why or why not?
ANSWER: To avoid ambiguity error java does not support multiple inheritance through class.
But through the interface, multiple inheritance is possible in java. No java doesn't support multiple inheritance directly
because it leads to overriding of methods when both extended classes have the same method name.

What is Method Overloading and when it happens?
ANSWER: Method Overloading is a programming technique that allows developers to use the same method name multiple times in the same class,
but with different parameters. In this case, we can say that the method is overloaded. A single method’s parameters
may differ in number, type, and order.

Explain “Exceptions” in Java and how to handle it.
ANSWER: Exception is an error event that can happen during the execution of a program and disrupts its normal flow. Java provides a robust
and object oriented way to handle exception scenarios, known as Java Exception Handling.

What is a static keyword in java? How has it been used in variables and methods?
ANSWER: How it has been used in variables and methods? The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all
instances of that class as it belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves.

What is “Final” and how have it been used as variables and methods?
ANSWER: Final is used in different contexts. First of all, final is a non-access modifier applicable only to a variable, a method or a class.
Following are different contexts where final is used. When a variable is declared with final keyword, its value can't be modified,
essentially, a constant.

What is final, finally and finalize?
ANSWER: Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. Finally is used to place
important code, it will be executed whether an exception is handled or not. Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before
the object is garbage collected.

What is a Constructor?
ANSWER: Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
ANSWER: Yes

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
ANSWER: default constructor

What is "this" keyword in java?
ANSWER: THIS is a reference variable in Java.

What is the "super" keyword in java? In how many possible ways can you use it?
ANSWER: super is used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable. We can use super keyword to access the data member or field of the parent class.

What does JVM stand for ?
ANSWER: Java virtual Machine

Is the JVM platform independent?
ANSWER: The JVM must be platform dependent.

What version of java are you using?
ANSWER: 1.8.0_281

What JAR stands for?
ANSWER: Java Archive, used to bundle a Java library containing many classes into a single file.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
ANSWER: JDK is for development purpose whereas JRE is for running the java programs. JDK and JRE both contain JVM so that we can run our java programs. JVM is the heart of the Java programming language and provides platform independence.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
ANSWER: JDK is for development purpose whereas JRE is for running the java programs. JDK and JRE both contain JVM so that we
can run our java program. JVM is the heart of java programming language and provides platform independence.

What is compile time and run time?
ANSWER: Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable while Run-time
is the instance where the executable is running.

What is Heap?
ANSWER: A Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property.

How Java manages its memory?
ANSWER: In Java, when we only declare a variable of a class type, only a reference is created.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
ANSWER: String is immutable, if you try to alter their values; another object gets created, whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder
are mutable so they can change their values. Thread-Safety Difference: The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that
StringBuffer is thread-safe.

What is Singleton Class?
ANSWER: In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
ANSWER: Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where
the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

When to use transient variable in java?
ANSWER: transient is a Java keyword which marks a member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes.

What’s the difference between while and do..while loop?
ANSWER: The most important difference between while and do-while loop is that in do-while , the block of code is executed at least once,
even though the condition given is false. ... In While loop, the condition is first tested and then the block of code is executed if
the test result is true.

What is Enum?
ANSWER: In java enums are represented using enum data type.

What is an Iterator?
ANSWER: Iterators are used in Collection framework in Java to retrieve elements one by one.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
ANSWER: Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
ANSWER: The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool.

What is Constructor Chaining in Java?
ANSWER: Constructor Chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor.

What’s the difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
ANSWER: A serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation,
while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What does JIT stand for?
ANSWER: Just In Time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
ANSWER: Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase
or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
ANSWER: No, Garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory. The purpose of garbage collection (GC) is to identify and discard objects that are no longer needed by a Java program, so that their resources can be reclaimed and reused.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
ANSWER: The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.

What is Reflection in java and why is it useful?
ANSWER: Reflection in Java is the ability to examine and/or modify the properties or behavior of an object at run-time.
Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes,
methods etc.. at compile time.

What is multithreading in java?
ANSWER: The process of executing multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.

What is Synchronization in Java?
ANSWER: Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource with multiple threads in Java. Synchronization in Java guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method which requires the same lock simultaneously or concurrently.

What are Frameworks?
ANSWER: Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of prewritten code to which you add your own code to solve a problem in
a specific domain.

What are the testing Frameworks available in java?
ANSWER:

Serenity
JUnit
TestNG
Cucumber
JBehave

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
ANSWER: Both TestNG and JUnit are open Sources. Both TestNG and JUnit are Testing frameworks used for Unit Testing.
TestNG is inspired by JUnit, so in a way these are similar. Few more functionalities are added to TestNG which makes it more powerful
than JUnit. Both JUnit and TestNG are without a doubt the most popular testing frameworks out there.

What are the dependencies of a project?
ANSWER: A project dependency is a logical, constraint-based or preferential relationship between two activities or tasks such that the completion or the initiation of one is reliant on the completion or initiation of the other.

What is dependency injection in java?
ANSWER: In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
ANSWER: The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as static or early binding. Binding of all the static,
private and final methods are done at compile-time. In Dynamic binding the compiler doesn’t decide the method to be called.
Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding.
